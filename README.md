# Big-Int-and-Big-Prime
Here is a simple implementation of large number class based on C++ STL deque. It support operation like addition, subtraction, complementation and multiplication.

Thanks to the CLRS book, I can implement a random large prime number generator based on Miller-Rabin test and the large number class. Howerver, it runs quite slow now.

My code annotation is in Chinese now. But I will translate the annotation into English ASAP.
